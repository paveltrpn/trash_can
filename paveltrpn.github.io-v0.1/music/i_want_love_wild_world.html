            Intro: <b>A</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>C#m</b> <b>C</b> <b>D</b>
            Verse 1:
            <b>A</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>E</b>
            I want love but it's impossible
            <b>C#m</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>D</b>
            <b>A</b> man like me so irresponsible
            <b>C#+</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>F#m/E</b>
            <b>A</b> man like me is dead in places
            <b>B</b> <b>D7/E</b> <b>E</b>
            Other men feel liberated.
            
            Verse 2: (The same as verse 1)
            And I can't love shot full of holes
            Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold.
            Don't feel nothing, just old scars
            Toughening up around my heart.
            
            Chorus:
            <b>A</b> <b>G/A</b>
            But I want love, just a different kind.
            <b>D</b> <b>Dm/F</b>
            I want a love won't break me down,
            <b>A</b> <b>F#+</b>
            Won't brick me up, won't fence me in.
            <b>B</b>
            I want a love that don't mean a thing.
            <b>E7</b> <b>C#/E</b> <b>E7</b> <b>Am/C</b> <b>D</b>
            That's the love I want. I want love.
            
            Verse 3: (The same as verse 1)
            I want love on my own terms,
            After everyting I've ever learned.
            Me, I carry too much baggage.
            Oh man, I've seen so much traffic.
            
            Bridge:
            <b>F</b> <b>C</b>
            So bring it on, I've been bruised.
            <b>G</b> <b>C</b>
            Don't give me love that's clean and smooth.
            <b>Cm</b> <b>Bb</b>
            I'm ready for the rougher stuff.
            <b>F</b> <b>D</b> <b>D/E</b> <b>E/G#</b>
            No sweet romance, I've had enough.
            
            Break: <b>A</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>E</b> <b>C#m</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>D</b>
            
            <b>C#+</b> <b>F#m</b> <b>F#m/E</b>
            <b>A</b> man like me is dead in places
